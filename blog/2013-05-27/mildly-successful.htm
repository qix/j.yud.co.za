  <h1>&ldquo;mildly successful&rdquo;</h1>

  <p>I <strong>failed</strong>.</p>

  <p>Three years of hard work... I knew the most likely outcome of my startup was failure. I still never imagined to be starting a blog post with that line.</p>

  <p>We had revenue on day one. We were profitable by the end of the first year. We recently started paying ourselves salaries off the company.</p>

  <p>We were bootstrapped, profitable, and proud.<p>

  <p>Why then, do I call it a failure?</p>

  <h3>giving up:</h3>

  <p>My fear for the last year is that we were mildly successful. Profitable enough to continue, but with a "salary" that is a far cry from what I could have been earning. That is a dangerous place for a startup to be in. Every month working at a reduced salary increases your sunk costs, and makes it harder psychologically to quit. If you never get out of the mildly successful bracket, your business can become a self propagating trap as it gets harder and harder to leave.</p>

  <p>Mildly successful isn't always a bad thing. A popular strategy is to aim to achieve a mildly successful startup while maintaining a better lifestyle then you could achieve elsewhere. While an admirable plan, and something I may embark on later in life, at this point it isn't what I want. Therefore it is rather problematic that our startup is in the mildly successful bracket. What I needed to work out though, was when/if we would break free of that: either to become properly successful and start paying myself a market salary, or fail fully and shut down.</p>

  <p>A couple months ago I decided to bite the bullet, and sign a contract with Facebook. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. I'm still not sure if I regret making it.</p>

  <p>The company I'm leaving behind still has a very good chance of success. A little more sales, reduced attrition rate, a bit money on marketing here and there. If everything goes well in another year or two I could be paying myself the same as the offer I received. It is also possible it would have taken three or four years, or perhaps we would never reach that point.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, me leaving has left a serious bullet wound. The rest of the team still wants to carry on, and they have my full support. Due to our lack of funding we never built up much of a development team, and with similar motivations the only other developer is leaving too. A SaaS without a technical team is problematic to put it mildly. The software is well designed and with another couple months work can mostly run itself. I am leaving though, and it will wound the product I've dedicated the last three years of my life to.</p>

  <p>When I say dedicated, I mean it. That is most of the reason it has come to this. I've missed out on a lot of opportunities over the last three years that I won't get back. I could maybe give one more year to see what happens, but that's what I said this time last year.</p>

  <p>It could have been different though. I believe there were a fair amount of mistakes that were my fault. There is a lot to learn from failure, and not many of the posts I've read have come from profitable startups. It brings a different perspective.</p>

  <h3>money (time):</h3>
  <p>The first thing I would change, is the idea of bootstrapping. It was interesting, but really - if you had asked me three years ago how much time I was willing to dedicate to this startup - I would have said three years. Three years isn't enough time to bootstrap a startup (unless you're lucky). I would say give it five &ndash; as a minimum.</p>

  <p>We definitely had too much on our plate. At least six-eight months were wasted trying to launch a second business. It was closely related and dependent on our current company, but eventually, and especially without funding - running two separate businesses was not viable and we shut it down. We also continued to run our previous mildly profitable company for a while, and started up a co-working space. Oops.</p>

  <p>Taking investment speeds things up. There is a limit to how much a startup can be sped up, and too much is definitely bad &ndash; but we could have safely moved 20-30% faster with some money to spend. That would have shaved off a year. It would also have reduced the negative bank balance induced stress.</p>

  <h3>team:</h3>
  <p>We were already almost two years in before we started to build a team. Now I would have easily given 5-10% of my stake to have a team, but back then it seemed ludicrous. I had put all of my savings into the company, and "purchased" an additional 4% share. Saying the valuation was optimistic is conservative.</p>
    
  <p>The first hires are the hardest. As a small startup basically all of our hires needed to come from people we already knew, which is already a small pool. Not having much money to pay, and only willing to give away shares according to our crazy valuation - meant we never really hired the people we wanted. When we did get good hires, the 0.5-2% stake we were offering apparently didn't mean much compared to the large salaries our competition was offering.</p>

  <p>Boring problems, are boring. The markets are easier to disrupt, but it does make hiring significantly harder. Without the offer of good salaries, the fact that we were working on billing was yet another nail in our hiring coffin.</p>

  <p>I believe remote startups can work, but we decided not to be. With the decision to have offices, it was a serious problem that the founders were in different cities. We had plans to relocate but I don't think they were ever taken as seriously as they needed to be. After three years we were still split into two cities. Three people in one, two in the other.</p>

  <h3>in closing:</h3>

  <p>Startups are hard. Bootstrapped startups are a little bit harder. I'm just adding my message to the pool of failed startup blog posts. I am not recommending against starting up a company, but it simply wasn't the right time for me to dedicate years of my life to it. I wish I had realised that a little bit sooner.</p>

  <p>I suppose my messages to potential founders are these:
    <blockquote>Running a startup is a lifestyle choice. If you're trying to achieve a lifestyle where you're not working hard while on an emotional rollercoaster &mdash; think hard about your choice.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Bootstrapping, with all its advantages, is going to take longer. If you're not in it for the long haul it is probably a bad idea. Then again, if you're not in it for the long haul, a startup may be a bad idea too.</blockquote>
  </p>

  <p><strong>p.s.</strong> The startup is not shutting down. Our plan at the moment is to cut down costs and try rebuild momentum slowly, eventually hiring a developer once we can afford it. This only works because my co-founder is in it for the long haul... unfortunately &mdash; I wasn't.</p>
