# Oaxaca, Dia de Muertos 2022

## Hello!

Hello over there! I've been struggling to find a way to share what I'm up to, that both feels easily accessible enough, but also private enough. I tried Instagram, but it feels too boastful, and with every post I had a renewed internal debate of why I was posting each image publicly.

My single goal here is to share updates in a way that makes others feel connected (hello mom!), and keeps communication lines open. Instead of comments I'm going to encourage y'all to reach out to me on Signal/WhatsApp and have this act as a trigger for conversations there.

## What was I doing in Oaxaca ("Wahaca")?

This story dates back to October 2017, when for a lot of reasons I had decided I needed to take some time off work. It only lasted a couple months before I had to go back to San Francisco, but I spent six weeks in Oaxaca studying Spanish. I lived with a family there, ate meals in their house, and attending a school during the day. Luckily the timing also overlapped with October 31st through November 2nd, where the city is absolutely lights up with a cultural explosion that must be a peak international experience.

Soon after that trip I decided at some point I needed to share the experience with friends. Around a year in advance I reserved a house in Oaxaca, and kicked planning into high gear about 3 months before. The house I found had eight bedrooms, and I was asking people to come for a little over a full week, so it was a challenge to fill the house. I was also being extremely picky on the invite list, trying to find a group that'd connect well, and also be willing to get a little weird. I was grateful for the friends that decided to trust me with their precious vacation time. In the end the last bedroom was taken two days before the trip was set to start.

I wanted the trip to be focused on the Oaxacan culture. We hit some natural highlights, a mezcal distillery.

## Planning was stressful

Trying to plan a trip to a country I don't know _that well_ was a challenge. There was a lot of room for things to go poorly, with my biggest fear being that we'd be unable to get transportation if it wasn't booked well ahead of time. The three days are an order of magnitude more busy than the entire rest of the year.

Mayra, a new friend, introduced me to a local guide who was extremely useful in planning. He wanted to plan the entire trip, but I eventually agreed on three daya because I was terrified of having too many eggs in that guide-basket. He made plans for a day shopping at a local market, taking us for a hike in his a cute neighborhood, and a Muerteada. I thought the Muerteada was a cemetery "party" I had attended back in 2015, but that wasn't the case. More on that later.

## Mexico city

My trip started in Mexico City. A city I've wanted to live in for a long time, and been thinking about spending months in. Soon after landing I decided that'd be this upcoming January through March. In no small part because I'm not mentally prepared for a New York City winter.

I decided to spend my time there bouncing between neighboorhoods, trying to get a better idea of where I might choose to plant myself. While walking around I listened to the Duolingo Spanish Podcast on Mexico City. It was a great way to warm up my Spanish, and also came with a whole lot of recommendations of places to go. The few I made it to were excellent.

The clear standout was Expendio de Maiz Sin Nombre (Expedition of Corn Without Name). It had come with a glowing recommendation from Olga, so it was at the tip of my list CDMX hit list. Here you're treated to unlimited courses of maize (read "mostly tortilla") based courses. After each a simple yes/no decides whether it was your last. A friend, Krista, happened to be in town so joined me there. The final bill came to around US $80 for five courses each, one more than I should've had but the food was so tasty it was hard to give the "no." Obviously we left and got Churros de Muertos afterwards. Churreria El Moro, a recommendation from the podcast, was excellent.

I spent the rest of the day checking out the local dog park, and pet stores to see which food brands they sell there. The night was spent at a Luche Libre show. Mike & Narmeen (also joining Oaxaca) were in town so we went together, and at their request we did it through a fancy AirBnB tour that brought along a guide who was one of the fighters that night. We were surprised to see him fighting without a mask.
