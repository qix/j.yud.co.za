  <h3>Give me a second here</h3>
  <p>This post was not nearly as clear as it was meant to be, and seems to have been misinterpreted a little.</p>
  
  <p>I'll put a clearer post up a bit later, but for now - our current plans are basically identical to what they always were. We're bootstrapping slowly, hiring when we can afford it and trying to build a highly profitable business.</p>

  <h3>Previous content</h3>
  <p>For those interested in the content that was here. Mildly successul refers to the stage every bootstrapped company goes through, where you're profitable but founders are still taking below market salaries in order to save money to grow the company. It is a good thing.</p>
