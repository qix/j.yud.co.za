Bitcoin and the gold standard
=============================

There is a debate whether or not bitcoin will ever succeed as a currency. For the most part I find that debate is asking the wrong question.

From my perspective bitcoin is one of the most important developments of the last hundred years. In the same league as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistor</a>. As most inventions are - its an incremental development, standing on the shoulders of all our achievements in cryptography (and obviously the transistor itself). 

Currency has powered our society allowing easy trade. The arrival of commodity based currency with gold allowed ancient civilization to trade freely. Advancing to political (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_currency">fiat</a>) based currency solved problems, but has been fraught with issues. Frankly the ability for restricted subset of the population to create money out of nothing is dangerous.

Math-based currency is without a doubt an important invention. The similarities to the gold standard means it comes with many of the same issues. There are reasons the gold standard is no longer in use in many countries, and while that might be relevant to the debate about using bitcoin as a currency, it is not entirely relevant to whether bitcoin can be used for other monetary functions.

Moving money around is a hard problem. There are fraud issues, political constraints, and security concerns. As it currently exists bitcoin is offering an alternative to the use of normal currency. It is a challenge to get money in and out of the system, but once you have money in bitcoin sending pieces to anyone else on the network becomes a trivial matter. The transaction fees you pay are actually related to the cost of confirming the transaction rather than the artificial pricing credit card companies have chosen to maximise their profits.

This change will enable micro-payments, which may bring about an entirely new class of content businesses. A band could potentially earn enough money to survive on based on a $0.05 per-download fee, but unfortunately fees and hassles of paying mean that model was previously impossible. If bitcoin becomes common place, setting up a similar model would be trivial.

This is not to say there wont be banks. I believe that banks have an important function in the bitcoin system, it is simply possibly for people to securely store money on their computers. The move to more jailed systems might make it possible, but banks will simply make the process easier. They will also allow for trusted instant payments and perhaps even pay interest. The ability for anyone to start a bitcoin bank will push competition in fee's down to a sane level, though trust will always be a problem. Having large sums of money in liquid bitcoin is a difficult security problem. It's a different problem to storing large amounts of cash, but I would venture to say harder.

The hardest problem bitcoin is going to have to solve is money laundering. The simple truth is that open and anonymous monetary systems attract. The old concept of following the money, is both significantly easier and impossible. The largest issues bitcoin is going to have to contend with, is international governments trying to shut it down for being associated with monery laundering and drug dealing.

There will be other competitors to bitcoin, and there is likely to be a proveably better alternative. They will all fail at getting serious adoption. Bitcoin built up trust very slowly over the last ten years. Early adoptors have been rewarded heavily for their involvement, but only 53.5% of the available bitcoins have been mined. The underlying algorithm can and has been changed through agreement with the majority of network users through <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals</a>.
