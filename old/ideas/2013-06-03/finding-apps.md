Finding apps
============

It seems very difficult and almost impossible to find the app I want.

Right now I want a clean, functional program that lets me track fitness statistics (daily weight, distance and time of runs) that I can then export and monitor.

Unfortunately Google is little to no help in finding apps, since its linking doesn't really suit that style technology.

It seems tho best solution is to have a site with rated apps. A simple search and curated app store, that people are paid to curate outside and much much more strictly than the standard app store.

You can pay to have your review expedited, but reviewers simply move through a queue. Only trusted people are allowed to review, perhaps once you get an app in next one is cheaper/free.
