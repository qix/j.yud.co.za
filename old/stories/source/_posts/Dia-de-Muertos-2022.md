Hello over there! I've been struggling to find a way to share what I'm up to, that both feels easily accessible enough, but also private enough. I tried Instagram, but it feels too boastful, and with every post I had a renewed internal debate of why I was posting each image publicly.

My single goal here is to share updates in a way that makes others feel connected (hello mom!), and keeps communication lines open. Instead of comments I'm going to encourage y'all to reach out to me on Signal/WhatsApp and have this act as a trigger for conversations there.

## What was I doing in Oaxaca?

This story dates back to October 2017, when for a lot of reasons I had decided I needed to take some time off work. It only lasted a couple months before I had to go back to San Francisco, but I spent six weeks in Oaxaca studying Spanish. I lived with a family there, ate meals in their house, and attending a school during the day. Luckily the timing also overlapped with October 31st through November 2nd. During those couple days, the city is lights up with a cultural explosion that, for me anyway, is one of the most special events on the planet.

Soon after that trip I decided at some point I needed to share the experience with friends. Around a year in advance I reserved a house in Oaxaca, and kicked planning into high gear about 3 months before. The house I found had eight bedrooms, and I was asking people to come for a little over a full week, so it was a challenge to fill the house. I was also being extremely picky on the invite list, trying to find a group that'd connect well, and also be willing to get a little weird. I was grateful for the friends that decided to trust me with their precious vacation time. In the end the last bedroom was taken two days before the trip was set to start.

## Mexico City

My trip started in Mexico City. A city I've wanted to live in for a long time, and been thinking about spending months in. Soon after landing I decided that'd be this upcoming January through March. In no small part because I'm not mentally prepared for a New York City winter.

I decided to spend my time there bouncing between neighboorhoods, trying to get a better idea of where I might choose to plant myself. While walking around I listened to the [Duolingo Spanish Podcast on Mexico City](https://podcast.duolingo.com/episode-119-mexico-city-mujeres-muralistas). It was a great way to warm up my Spanish, and also came with a whole lot of recommendations of places to go. The few I made it to were excellent.

Started my day at [Bosque de Chapultepec](https://www.google.com/maps?q=loc:19.4228833,-99.1749944) which is a giant park out there. Really liked this statue, and the cute snail.

<div class="img-grid">
{% asset_img cdmx-horse.jpg "Meta-horse" %}
{% asset_img cdmx-cute-snail.jpg "Just snailing around" %}
</div>

Next stop was [Cafebrería El Péndulo](https://goo.gl/maps/MHFoD1K4owijVZGL9) that was recommended both by Olga and the podcast I was listening to. Coffee shop and bookstore. cute.

<div class="img-grid">
{% asset_img cdmx-cafebreria.jpg "Cafebreria coffee stop" %}
</div>

I had lunch plans but was getting hungry so stopped for a snack at [Cafe Nin](https://goo.gl/maps/fhnojqfyGEyf6FFYA). I had a tamale with huitlacoche ("corn smut" in english, I prefer the spanish name). It's flavour is strong mushroom.

<div class="img-grid">
{% asset_img cdmx-nin-tamale.jpg "Thinking about the SF Tamale lady" %}
</div>

Since I'll be coming back with Toaster (or Tostado as he'll be known) I checked out a pet store to see the dog food brands, met a cute cat. Went to check the dog park as well which is giant.

<div class="img-grid">
{% asset_img cdmx-pet-store.jpg "Cat was hiding between the food bags" %}
{% asset_img dog-park.jpg "Dog park" %}
</div>

Lunch was at [Expendio de Maiz Sin Nombre](https://goo.gl/maps/G6aQLLhWroA7e4py5) where I met up with a friend, Krista, from NYC. There was no menu, they'd bring out an (always corn based) course, and then afterwards a simple yes/no decided whether you were done. It wasn't cheap but was suuper tasty. I was too distracted to take photos, so here's the starting snack (only photo I got.)

<div class="img-grid">
{% asset_img sin-nombre.jpg "It is not a good photo." %}
</div>

I got a couple more snaps wandering around the area.

### Luche Libre

Finally that night I wanted to see some Luche Libre. I was planning on just buying tickets but Mike & Narmeen convinced me to join them on an AirBnB experience that included meeting one of the fighters. It was a good idea, and would not have understood what was going on without that.

### Breakfast and Markets

Finally before my flight out to Oaxaca I had a little bit of time, I used it to grab some excellent Chilaquiles back at [Cafe Nin](https://goo.gl/maps/fhnojqfyGEyf6FFYA) (last nights tortillas chips, covered in sauce and served for breakfast.)

{% asset_img chilaquiles.jpg %}
Last stop before the airport was a market, hoping to find some small Día de Muertos gifts for everyone on my Oaxaca trip, and I found these skulls. Was a little worried but they made the flight!

## Oaxaca

The first day in Oaxaca we just spent wandering around.

<div class="img-grid">

For dinner we stopped at [Los Dazantes](https://g.page/danzantesoaxaca)

<div class="img-grid">
{% asset_img oaxaca-1-las-dazantes.jpg %}
</div>

Day two started with a visit to the house I stayed at while I lived there, unfortunately no-one was home.

<div class="img-grid">
{% asset_img oaxaca-2-old-house.jpg %}
</div>

Lunch was at [Las Quince Letras](https://goo.gl/maps/WK883VghRHNUdXp59), named for the fifteen letters in it's name, was one of my favourite meals from back when I lived in the city. It's still delicious, but this time I figured out it was because it was only meal there that really tasted fresh. Everything's delicious, but it's all corn based or heavy.

<div class="img-grid">
{% asset_img oaxaca-2-chiles-de-agua.jpg %}
</div>

That night we watched a parade

<div class="img-grid">

Finally after the parade the last couple people had landed, and we went out for some drinks as a group.

### Mezcal Farm Tour

As the cactus ages the leaves open up, you can see evidence of that here

We were lucky to see them distilling

I took a walk back with Megan through the streets of Jalatlaco.

{% asset_img jalatlaco-tree.jpg %}

She was looking for inspiration for a tattoo with marigolds inside so we went to take a photo here. Some people there, took this photo of us.

{% asset_img street-art-tattoo.jpg %}

{% asset_img bench-josh.jpg %}

It's a little hard to explain, but they attached fireworks to a cow.
{% asset_img cow-fireworks.jpg %}

One of the parades went right passed our house, so I went up to the roof to catch this shot
{% asset_img parade-from-roof.jpg %}

### Last full day

My last full day I spent catching up with everyone, as well as attempting (but not succeeding) in getting my face painted in preparation for the Muerteada that night.

Thanks for reading! I still need to edit and add a lot of text.
