Hello over there! I've been struggling to find a way to share what I'm up to, that both feels easily accessible enough, but also private enough. I tried Instagram, but it feels too boastful, and with every post I had a renewed internal debate of why I was posting each image publicly.

My single goal here is to share updates in a way that makes others feel connected (hello mom!), and keeps communication lines open. Instead of comments I'm going to encourage y'all to reach out to me on Signal/WhatsApp and have this act as a trigger for conversations there.

## What was I doing in Oaxaca?

This story dates back to October 2017, when for a lot of reasons I had decided I needed to take some time off work. It only lasted a couple months before I had to go back to San Francisco, but I spent six weeks in Oaxaca studying Spanish. I lived with a family there, ate meals in their house, and attending a school during the day. Luckily the timing also overlapped with October 31st through November 2nd. During those couple days, the city is lights up with a cultural explosion that, for me anyway, is one of the most special events on the planet.

Soon after that trip I decided at some point I needed to share the experience with friends. Around a year in advance I reserved a house in Oaxaca, and kicked planning into high gear about 3 months before. The house I found had eight bedrooms, and I was asking people to come for a little over a full week, so it was a challenge to fill the house. I was also being extremely picky on the invite list, trying to find a group that'd connect well, and also be willing to get a little weird. I was grateful for the friends that decided to trust me with their precious vacation time. In the end the last bedroom was taken two days before the trip was set to start.

## Mexico City

My trip started in Mexico City. A city I've wanted to live in for a long time, and been thinking about spending months in. Soon after landing I decided that'd be this upcoming January through March. In no small part because I'm not mentally prepared for a New York City winter.

I decided to spend my time there bouncing between neighboorhoods, trying to get a better idea of where I might choose to plant myself. While walking around I listened to the [Duolingo Spanish Podcast on Mexico City](https://podcast.duolingo.com/episode-119-mexico-city-mujeres-muralistas). It was a great way to warm up my Spanish, and also came with a whole lot of recommendations of places to go. The few I made it to were excellent.

Started my day at [Bosque de Chapultepec](https://www.google.com/maps?q=loc:19.4228833,-99.1749944) which is a giant park out there. Really liked this statue, and the cute snail.

Next stop was [Cafebrería El Péndulo](https://goo.gl/maps/MHFoD1K4owijVZGL9) that was recommended both by Olga and the podcast I was listening to. Coffee shop and bookstore. cute.

I had lunch plans but was getting hungry so stopped for a snack at [Cafe Nin](https://goo.gl/maps/fhnojqfyGEyf6FFYA). I had a tamale with huitlacoche ("corn smut" in english, I prefer the spanish name). It's flavour is strong mushroom.

Since I'll be coming back with Toaster (or Tostado as he'll be known) I checked out a pet store to see the dog food brands, met a cute cat. Went to check the dog park as well which is giant.

Lunch was at [Expendio de Maiz Sin Nombre](https://goo.gl/maps/G6aQLLhWroA7e4py5) where I met up with a friend, Krista, from NYC. There was no menu, they'd bring out an (always corn based) course, and then afterwards a simple yes/no decided whether you were done. It wasn't cheap but was suuper tasty. I was too distracted to take photos, so here's the starting snack (only photo I got.)

I got a couple more snaps wandering around the area.

Finally that night I wanted to see some Luche Libre. I was planning on just buying tickets but Mike & Narmeen convinced me to join them on an AirBnB experience that included meeting one of the fighters. It was a good idea, and would not have understood what was going on without that.

Finally before my flight out to Oaxaca I had a little bit of time, I used it to grab some excellent Chilaquiles back at [Cafe Nin](https://goo.gl/maps/fhnojqfyGEyf6FFYA) (last nights tortillas chips, covered in sauce and served for breakfast.)

Last stop before the airport was a market, hoping to find some small Día de Muertos gifts for everyone on my Oaxaca trip, and I found these skulls. Was a little worried but they made the flight!
