  I guess I have a lot of ideas, and don&apos;t know which to list right now.

  <ul>
    <li>A sandwich store that allows <strong>full customisation</strong>. I want to choose my ingredients and their quantities. Not always, sometimes a menu is nice, but the menu can be populated by the most ordered sandwiches.</li>
    <li>A high rise, or some kind of community building, with sub-minute parcel delivery. Living in a space like that would enable easy tool rental, reduce the need for personal fridge space, and provide ripe fruit/vegatables with way less waste.</li>
  </ul>
